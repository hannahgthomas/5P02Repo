###  Feedback:

**Q1:**
* Unfortunately it didn't work for me because you had ``size=(rand_n_trials)`` and `rand_n_trials`was undefined. 
* **code**: 2/3, **documentation** 3/3

**Q2:**
* Excellent! Love your use of slicing!
* **code**: 5/5, **documentation** 5/5

**Q3:**
* Didn't compare the two means against each other. And where's the documentation?!
* **code**: 4/5, **documentation** 3/5

**Q4:**
* You definitely I think made things more difficult for yourself by trying to put everything inside a dictionary.
* This also required you to hard code your subject numbers. Why not just try to put everything into a loop and re-use the code from Q1?
* **code**: 2.5/5, **documentation** 5/5

**Q5**
* Almost there. Don't forget to document! 
* **code**: 3/5, **documentation** 3/5

**Q6**
* Good. Careful where you start your getClock though because you start it before a flip that isn't drawing the message. It's basically only off by 1 frame but that `win.flip()` is unnecessary. 
* Also you didn't close the window so I almost had to restart my system!
* **code**: 3/4, **documentation** 4/4

:memo: **Total:** 42.5/54
